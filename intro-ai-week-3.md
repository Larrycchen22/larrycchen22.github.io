# Rock Paper Scissors Identifier

## **a. How does Teachable Machine use machine learning to solve problems?**  
Teachable Machine uses **supervised learning** to train AI models. Users provide labeled data (images, sounds, or poses), and the system **learns patterns** using a **neural network**. It then classifies new inputs based on the training data, enabling real-time AI-based predictions without requiring programming knowledge.

---

## **b. What application did you create using Teachable Machine?**  
I created a **Rock-Paper-Scissors Identifier**, which recognizes **hand gestures** for Rock, Paper, and Scissors using a webcam.

---

## **c. What problem does it solve?**  
This model automates **gesture recognition** in the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It can be programmed to **determine the winner automatically** when two gestures are detected, removing the need for manual judgment.

---

## **d. Why did you choose this application?**  
I selected this project because:  
- **Demonstrates machine learning classification** in a simple yet engaging way.  
- **Has real-world potential**—could be expanded into a **gesture-based interactive game**.  
- **Enhances user interaction** by automating game decisions, making it more dynamic.  

With additional programming, this model could evolve into a **real-time AI-powered Rock-Paper-Scissors game with automatic scoring**.
