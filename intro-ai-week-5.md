# **Analyzing Conversations with LLM for Book Analysis**  

## **a. What book did you choose, and why?**  
I chose **Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland** because it’s a literary classic filled with **rich themes, symbolism, and whimsical logic**, making it a great candidate for AI-driven analysis.  

---

## **b. What did you ask the LLM to do, or how did you interact with it using the book?**  
I first uploaded the book file and asked **direct questions**. While the responses were satisfactory, I improved the interaction by crafting a **prompt instructing GPT to act as an expert literary analyst**. This led to a **more engaging and nuanced analysis**.  

---

## **c. Were there any limitations or challenges you faced while using the LLM?**  
- **Prompt Engineering Matters:** Without a well-structured prompt, the responses were more general and required refinement.  
- **Accuracy & Specificity:** The LLM sometimes **lacked precision** when given vague instructions.  
- **Limited Subjectivity:** Unlike human readers who bring personal experiences into interpretation, the LLM provides **objective summaries unless explicitly guided** to consider multiple perspectives.  

---

## **d. Did the LLM correctly provide the response(s) you expected?**  
Yes, ChatGPT performed well in both attempts. However, some **AI-specific patterns** stood out:  
- **Well-structured but sometimes predictable responses.**  
- **Uniform analysis**—while humans interpret books uniquely, the LLM delivers **more standardized insights** unless prompted to explore **contrasting viewpoints**.  

---

## **e. The Fun of Interacting with an LLM**  
Working with an LLM revealed fascinating differences between **human reasoning and AI-driven analysis**:  
- **No personal opinions**—it generates responses based on probabilities, not personal experience.  
- **Explicit guidance needed**—unlike humans who naturally infer deeper meanings, the LLM requires structured prompts to explore diverse interpretations.  

This experience highlights how **powerful yet fundamentally different** LLMs are compared to human thought. They excel at structured analysis but lack the **emotions, intuition, and lived experiences** that shape human interpretation.
